# Getting Started with Runestone

**Generated on: 2025-08-21 16:44:46 UTC**

Runestone is a declarative, drift-aware Infrastructure-as-Code platform that provides stateless, multi-cloud ready infrastructure management with human-centric CLI workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ataiva-software/runestone.git
cd runestone
go build -o runestone .
```

#### Install Globally
```bash
go install github.com/ataiva-software/runestone@latest
```

### 2. Create Your First Configuration

Create a file called `infra.yaml`:

```yaml
project: my-first-project
environment: dev
variables:
  region: us-east-1
  tags:
    owner: platform-team
    purpose: demo

providers:
  aws:
    region: "${region}"
    profile: default

resources:
  # S3 bucket for application logs
  - kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: my-app-logs-${environment}
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags: "${tags}"
    driftPolicy:
      autoHeal: true
      notifyOnly: false

  # Multiple web servers using count
  - kind: aws:ec2:instance
    name: web-${index}
    count: 2
    properties:
      instance_type: t3.micro
      ami: ami-0abcdef1234567890
      tags:
        Name: "web-${index}"
        Environment: "${environment}"
    driftPolicy:
      autoHeal: true
      notifyOnly: false
```

### 3. Bootstrap Your Environment

```bash
runestone bootstrap
```

This command:
- Validates your configuration
- Installs required providers
- Expands resources (2 EC2 instances + 1 S3 bucket = 3 total resources)

### 4. Preview Changes

```bash
runestone preview
```

This shows you what changes will be made without actually applying them.

### 5. Apply Changes

```bash
runestone commit
```

This applies the changes to your infrastructure.

### 6. Monitor for Drift

```bash
# One-time drift check
runestone align --once

# Continuous monitoring (runs every 5 minutes)
runestone align
```

### 7. Clean Up

```bash
runestone dismantle --auto-approve
```

## 🔧 Key Concepts

### Stateless Design
Runestone doesn't use state files. Instead, it queries your cloud providers directly to understand the current state of your infrastructure.

### Expression Language
Use `${variable}` syntax for dynamic values:
- `${region}` - Variable substitution
- `${environment == 'prod' ? 't3.large' : 't3.micro'}` - Conditional expressions
- `${index}` - Loop index for count-based resources

### Drift Detection
Runestone continuously monitors your infrastructure and can automatically fix drift when `autoHeal: true` is set.

### DAG Execution
Resources are executed in dependency order using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallelization.
