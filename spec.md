i want to create an IaC tool, much like Terraform, but with the lessons learnt and addressing the pitfalls and weaknesses that Terraform has had to deal with.
come up with a unique name and a problem statement that it will solve, as well as the primary MVP specs
ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚Äî you want something that hits the same niche as Terraform but feels next-gen, with a clear identity, a focused problem statement, and concrete MVP specs. Here's a proposal:

üîπ Name Suggestion

Terranova (Latin: new earth, signifying a new foundation for infrastructure)
or
Praxis (Greek: practice/action, about turning infrastructure theory into applied reality)
or
Runestone (historical permanence, carved once but can be updated ‚Äî a metaphor for declarative, evolving infra).

üëâ Of these, Runestone feels strong, memorable, and unique while staying in the Terraform/InfraOps spirit.

üîπ Problem Statement

Infrastructure-as-Code today is powerful but brittle. Tools like Terraform introduced declarative infra at scale but suffer from state drift, locking conflicts, brittle module composition, and limited native orchestration. Teams wrestle with state management, dependency ordering, and scaling across multi-cloud/hybrid environments.

Runestone solves this by providing stateless, conflict-free, distributed IaC execution with real-time reconciliation and modular, language-native extensibility. It eliminates Terraform‚Äôs pain points around state files, plan/apply drift, and complex module versioning‚Äîwhile retaining a familiar declarative workflow.

üîπ Primary MVP Specs

1. Stateless Infra Engine

No centralized state.tfstate file.

Infra state is inferred from cloud provider APIs + cached snapshots.

Allows multiple users/CI/CD pipelines to run without lock contention.

2. Real-Time Drift Detection

Periodic reconciliation with provider APIs.

Auto-detects & surfaces config drift before apply.

Optional auto-healing mode (like Kubernetes reconciliation for infra).

3. First-Class Multi-Cloud Support

Pluggable provider system (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, VMware at MVP).

Supports cross-cloud dependencies natively (e.g., AWS S3 bucket feeding GCP BigQuery pipeline).

4. Strong Dependency Graph & Orchestration

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) execution engine.

Parallel execution where safe, deterministic ordering where required.

Explicit dependency declaration (depends_on equivalent) but with more automation (detects hidden deps).

5. Language-Native Modules

Instead of only HCL-like DSL, modules are written in Go or YAML + schema (no DSL lock-in).

Library approach (versioned, typed modules), no need for complex registry hacks.

6. Seamless CI/CD Integration

GitOps-ready: native diff/plan output as JSON, Markdown, or console UI.

Works with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, ArgoCD, etc.

7. Human-Centric UX

Predictable CLI (runestone plan, runestone apply, runestone reconcile).

Rich plan output with color-coded diffs.

Interactive approve mode for manual changes.

 MVP Delivery =

CLI engine

AWS + GCP + Kubernetes providers

Drift detection + reconciliation loop

Simple Go/YAML module system

JSON diff/plan for CI integration

Would you like me to map Runestone directly against Terraform‚Äôs pain points in a comparison table (so it‚Äôs super clear why someone would switch), or should I expand the roadmap to include where this tool could evolve long-term (e.g., policy as code, infra observability, self-healing infra)?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs do both:

üîπ Terraform Pain Points vs Runestone Solutions
Terraform Weakness Why It Hurts Runestone Approach
Centralized State File Locking conflicts, corruption risk, hard to scale across teams. Stateless execution ‚Äî infra state pulled dynamically from providers + cached snapshots, no global lock file.
Drift Only at Apply You only see drift during plan/apply. Continuous reconciliation loop ‚Äî drift surfaced in real-time, optional auto-healing.
Modules are brittle HCL modules break easily, version pinning is messy, no type safety. Language-native modules in Go/YAML with schema validation + versioned libraries.
Limited Orchestration Hard to express dependencies across providers/clouds. Strong DAG engine with parallelism + implicit dependency detection + explicit depends_on.
Opaque Error Messages ‚ÄúError: resource already exists‚Äù ‚Üí confusing. Human-centric UX ‚Äî errors with actionable remediation steps + context.
Poor Multi-Cloud UX Each provider works but cross-cloud orchestration is painful. First-class multi-cloud ‚Äî built-in support for linking resources across AWS/GCP/Azure/K8s.
GitOps Unfriendly Output Plan outputs aren‚Äôt structured, hard for pipelines to consume. Structured diff output ‚Äî JSON + Markdown + console UI, designed for CI/CD/GitOps.
Slow on Large Infra Sequential bottlenecks, poor caching. Optimized DAG execution + intelligent caching for large-scale infra.
üîπ Runestone Roadmap (Beyond MVP)

Phase 1 (MVP)

Stateless engine (AWS/GCP/K8s providers)

Drift detection + reconciliation loop

Go/YAML module system

CI/CD integration (JSON/Markdown plan output)

Phase 2 (Team Scale)

Policy-as-Code (OPA/Rego or Runestone-native) ‚Üí enforce compliance before deploy.

Provider SDK ‚Üí easy to write new cloud/service providers.

Workspace model ‚Üí team-friendly, supports multi-env (dev/qa/prod) natively.

Phase 3 (Next-Gen InfraOps)

Self-Healing Infrastructure ‚Üí reconciliation loop can automatically fix drift.

Observability Hooks ‚Üí metrics/logging/tracing for infra actions.

GraphQL/REST API ‚Üí programmatic access for other systems.

Infra Linting & Cost Analysis ‚Üí catch mistakes and cost spikes pre-deploy.

Phase 4 (Vision)

Universal Infra Control Plane ‚Üí Runestone becomes the backbone for IaC across multi-cloud/hybrid infra.

Plugin Ecosystem ‚Üí community-driven providers/modules.

Optional GUI Dashboard ‚Üí visualization of infra graph, drift, and changes.

 The core philosophy:
Terraform = declarative configs + static state file.
Runestone = declarative configs + living reconciliation loop (more like Kubernetes, less like Terraform).

Do you want me to sketch out what the Runestone CLI workflow would look like (like plan/apply/reconcile examples with sample output), so you can visualize how it feels different from Terraform?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Great ‚Äî here‚Äôs how the Runestone CLI workflow could look and feel compared to Terraform.

üîπ Core CLI Workflow

1. Init (set up providers + modules)
runestone init

Downloads providers (AWS, GCP, K8s, etc.).

Pulls modules from registry/Git.

Validates configuration + schema.

Output example:

 Provider aws (v0.2.1) installed
 Provider gcp (v0.1.9) installed
 Module network/vpc pulled from git::github.com/org/modules
 Configuration validated

2. Plan (dry-run with real-time drift info)
runestone plan

Instead of only comparing config ‚Üí state file, Runestone also checks provider APIs for drift:

Output example:

 Reconciling infrastructure...

Detected drift:
  ‚Ä¢ aws_s3_bucket.logs has extra tag "env=qa" (not in config)
  ‚Ä¢ gcp_sql_instance.db-prod allocated_size = 50GB (expected 100GB)

Planned changes:

+ aws_s3_bucket.logs (create)
  ~ gcp_sql_instance.db-prod (resize: 50GB ‚Üí 100GB)

+ aws_iam_user.temp_user (delete)

Summary:
  2 to change, 1 to add, 1 to delete

üëâ Output is also available as JSON or Markdown for CI/CD.

3. Apply (safe, parallel DAG execution)
runestone apply

Runestone builds the DAG of resources, runs what it can in parallel, and surfaces a live execution graph:

 Applying changes...

  [parallel] aws_s3_bucket.logs .......................... CREATED
  [serial]   gcp_sql_instance.db-prod .................... RESIZED (50GB ‚Üí 100GB)
  [delete]   aws_iam_user.temp_user ...................... REMOVED

 Apply complete in 1m42s

4. Reconcile (continuous drift correction)
runestone reconcile

This is where Runestone feels different from Terraform. Instead of waiting until a manual plan/apply, it periodically checks reality vs config, and either reports or auto-heals:

 Reconciling current infra state...

  Drift detected:
    ‚Ä¢ aws_ec2.instance.web-1 is stopped (expected running)

  Action taken:
    ‚Ä¢ aws_ec2.instance.web-1 restarted

 Infrastructure reconciled (2 drift issues resolved)

üëâ Users can set --auto-heal=false if they just want reporting.

5. Destroy
runestone destroy

Straightforward, but with dependency-safe teardown and drift awareness.

  The following resources will be destroyed:

+ aws_s3_bucket.logs
+ gcp_sql_instance.db-prod

 Destroy complete (2m18s)

üîπ Key Differentiators in UX

Drift visible at plan, not just at apply.

Reconcile loop = infra acts more like Kubernetes (always converging on desired state).

Parallel execution visualization (live DAG view instead of static text).

Human-centric diffs (color-coded + JSON/Markdown export).

üëâ With this workflow, Runestone feels less like "batch IaC" and more like a living infra control plane.

Do you want me to draft a sample config file format (Go/YAML-based) so you can see what writing infra in Runestone would look like vs Terraform‚Äôs HCL?

You said:
i dont want to make it too similar to terraform, so using 'plan' and 'apply'. maybe something else?
also 2 to change, 1 to add, 1 to delete at the end seems too close to terraform. what else could we do?
ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç ‚Äî if you want to avoid Runestone feeling like ‚ÄúTerraform v2‚Äù, then the language, verbs, and output framing should feel fresh but still intuitive. Here‚Äôs a proposal:

üîπ Alternative CLI Verbs

Terraform verbs ‚Üí Runestone alternatives:

Terraform Runestone Proposal Rationale
init bootstrap Feels foundational, aligns with "carving the runestone."
plan preview / sketch More human, less ‚ÄúTerraform clone.‚Äù Emphasizes exploratory dry-run.
apply commit / engrave Fits the Runestone metaphor ‚Äî finalizing desired state.
reconcile align / sync / heal Strong action verb that suggests bringing reality back to config.
destroy dismantle / shatter / purge Keeps metaphorical flavor, clearly destructive.

üëâ My vote for consistency:

bootstrap, preview, commit, align, dismantle.
They feel both DevOps-y and Runestone-themed, without being cheesy.

üîπ Alternative Change Summary Language

Terraform says: ‚Äú2 to change, 1 to add, 1 to delete‚Äù
We can frame it differently, with more narrative and human-readable phrasing.

Option A: Categorical Summary
Changes detected:

+ 1 new resource will be created
   ~ 2 resources will be updated

+ 1 resource will be removed

Option B: Delta-Oriented
Change set summary:
   Create:   1
   Update:   2
   Remove:   1

Option C: Runestone Metaphor
Chisel marks to be made:

+ Carve 1 new resource
   ~ Shape 2 existing resources

+ Erase 1 resource

Option D: Business-Friendly / Conversational
Upcoming adjustments:
   ‚Ä¢ 1 resource will be introduced
   ‚Ä¢ 2 resources will be modified
   ‚Ä¢ 1 resource will be retired

üîπ Example Runestone Session (Putting it Together)
runestone preview

Output:

 Inspecting live infrastructure...

Drift observed:
  ‚Ä¢ gcp_sql_instance.db-prod is at 50GB (expected 100GB)
  ‚Ä¢ aws_s3_bucket.logs has extra tag "env=qa"

Proposed adjustments:

+ Introduce: 1 resource (aws_s3_bucket.logs)
   ~ Modify:   2 resources (gcp_sql_instance.db-prod, aws_iam_role.app_role)

+ Retire:   1 resource (aws_iam_user.temp_user)

Next step: run `runestone commit` to engrave these changes.

 This way it doesn‚Äôt read like Terraform output, feels more human, and reinforces Runestone‚Äôs metaphor of ‚Äúengraving / shaping infra.‚Äù

Would you like me to lean harder into the Runestone metaphor (engraving, chiseling, carving, erasing) for the CLI UX, or keep it clean + professional (preview, commit, align, dismantle) so it appeals to enterprises as well?

You said:
option A is the best..
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëå ‚Äî Option A is the sweet spot: clean, clear, and professional, without feeling like a Terraform clone.

So the Runestone CLI UX could look like this:

Example Workflow with Option A Style
runestone preview

Output:

 Inspecting live infrastructure...

Drift detected:
  ‚Ä¢ gcp_sql_instance.db-prod is at 50GB (expected 100GB)
  ‚Ä¢ aws_s3_bucket.logs has extra tag "env=qa"

Changes detected:

+ 1 new resource will be created
   ~ 2 resources will be updated

+ 1 resource will be removed

Next: run `runestone commit` to apply these changes.

runestone commit

Output:

 Committing infrastructure changes...

+ Created aws_s3_bucket.logs
   ~ Updated gcp_sql_instance.db-prod (50GB ‚Üí 100GB)
   ~ Updated aws_iam_role.app_role (policy adjustment)

+ Removed aws_iam_user.temp_user

 Commit complete (duration: 1m42s)

runestone align

Output:

 Aligning desired state with reality...

   ‚Ä¢ Restarted aws_ec2.instance.web-1 (was stopped, expected running)
   ‚Ä¢ Corrected IAM role policy on aws_iam_role.app_role

 Infrastructure aligned (2 drift issues resolved)

Why Option A Works

Simple categories (+, ~, -) are universally understood.

Words instead of numbers-first makes it feel less ‚ÄúTerraform-y.‚Äù

Professional tone ‚Üí enterprises won‚Äôt dismiss it as ‚Äúcute metaphors.‚Äù

Still developer-friendly: quick glance shows adds/updates/removes.

üëâ Do you want me to now design what the Runestone config file format could look like (YAML/Go-based), so you can see how users would actually define resources in it?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Alright, let‚Äôs design the Runestone config format so it‚Äôs:

Not HCL (to avoid Terraform similarity)

Human-readable (YAML/TOML style)

Strictly typed (schemas, avoids Terraform‚Äôs ‚Äústringly typed‚Äù mess)

Composable (modules/libraries)

üîπ Config Format Proposal: YAML with Schema Validation
Example: AWS + GCP Resources
project: "analytics-platform"
environment: "prod"

providers:
  aws:
    region: "us-east-1"
    profile: "prod"
  gcp:
    project_id: "my-gcp-project"
    region: "us-central1"

resources:

+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: logs
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags:
        owner: "platform-team"
        purpose: "log-archive"

+ kind: gcp:sql:instance
    name: db-prod
    properties:
      tier: db-custom-2-8192
      storage_gb: 100
      backup_enabled: true

üîπ Key Concepts

kind = <provider>:<service>:<resource>

Clear namespacing, avoids Terraform‚Äôs resource-type spaghetti.

Easy to grep/search in large repos.

properties

Strict schema per resource type (validated before execution).

Strong typing ‚Üí "100" vs 100 matters (no silent coercion).

Providers Defined Once

Shared across resources (no copy-paste).

Native Cross-Cloud Dependencies

+ kind: aws:iam:role
  name: data-loader
  properties:
    trust: gcp:sql:instance.db-prod
    policies:
      - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

^ This lets AWS IAM trust a GCP SQL instance natively, something Terraform makes messy.

üîπ Modules Example
modules:
  vpc:
    source: github.com/runestone-modules/aws-vpc
    version: 1.2.0
    inputs:
      cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
      subnets:
        - name: public
          cidr: "10.0.1.0/24"
        - name: private
          cidr: "10.0.2.0/24"

resources:

+ kind: module:vpc
    name: core-network

Modules = versioned packages (like npm crates or Go modules).

Inputs are schema-validated, no ‚Äúmagical variables‚Äù like in Terraform.

üîπ Drift-Aware Config Extensions

We can optionally add drift policy per resource:

+ kind: aws:ec2:instance
  name: web-1
  properties:
    instance_type: t3.medium
    ami: "ami-12345"
  driftPolicy:
    autoHeal: true     # restart/resize automatically
    notifyOnly: false  # if true ‚Üí only report drift, don‚Äôt fix

This makes drift handling explicit at the config level (Terraform doesn‚Äôt have this).

üîπ Why This Format Works

Looks familiar (YAML) but not Terraform-ish.

Strongly typed ‚Üí avoids runtime errors Terraform often gives at apply.

Composable ‚Üí modules are libraries, not ‚Äúregistry hacks.‚Äù

Readable at scale ‚Üí kind-based namespacing is cleaner than aws_s3_bucket.

Do you want me to show you how a real-world config + CLI flow would look end-to-end (e.g., define infra in YAML ‚Üí run preview ‚Üí see drift/change summary ‚Üí commit)? That would make Runestone‚Äôs developer experience really concrete.

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through a full end-to-end Runestone workflow with a real-world example.

üîπ Example: Analytics Platform (AWS + GCP)

We‚Äôll define:

An AWS S3 bucket for logs

A GCP SQL instance for analytics

A module for a VPC

1. Configuration File (infra.yaml)
project: "analytics-platform"
environment: "prod"

providers:
  aws:
    region: "us-east-1"
    profile: "prod"
  gcp:
    project_id: "my-gcp-project"
    region: "us-central1"

modules:
  vpc:
    source: github.com/runestone-modules/aws-vpc
    version: 1.2.0
    inputs:
      cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
      subnets:
        - name: public
          cidr: "10.0.1.0/24"
        - name: private
          cidr: "10.0.2.0/24"

resources:

+ kind: module:vpc
    name: core-network

+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: logs
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags:
        owner: "platform-team"
        purpose: "log-archive"

+ kind: gcp:sql:instance
    name: db-prod
    properties:
      tier: db-custom-2-8192
      storage_gb: 100
      backup_enabled: true
  driftPolicy:
      autoHeal: true
      notifyOnly: false

2. Bootstrap (install providers/modules)
runestone bootstrap

Output:

 Provider aws (v0.3.1) installed
 Provider gcp (v0.2.5) installed
 Module vpc (v1.2.0) pulled from github.com/runestone-modules/aws-vpc
 Configuration validated against schemas

3. Preview (dry-run + drift check)
runestone preview

Output:

 Inspecting live infrastructure...

Drift detected:
  ‚Ä¢ gcp_sql_instance.db-prod is at 50GB (expected 100GB)
  ‚Ä¢ aws_s3_bucket.logs has extra tag "env=qa"

Changes detected:

+ 1 new resource will be created
   ~ 2 resources will be updated

+ 1 resource will be removed

4. Commit (engrave desired state)
runestone commit

Output:

 Committing infrastructure changes...

+ Created aws_s3_bucket.logs
   ~ Updated gcp_sql_instance.db-prod (50GB ‚Üí 100GB)
   ~ Updated aws_iam_role.app_role (policy adjustment)

+ Removed aws_iam_user.temp_user

 Commit complete (duration: 1m42s)

5. Align (continuous reconciliation)
runestone align

Output:

 Aligning desired state with reality...

   ‚Ä¢ Restarted aws_ec2.instance.web-1 (was stopped, expected running)
   ‚Ä¢ Corrected IAM role policy on aws_iam_role.app_role

 Infrastructure aligned (2 drift issues resolved)

üîπ Key Takeaways

Bootstrap replaces init (cleaner mental model).

Preview ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Align feels fresh, not Terraform-y.

Option A summary style keeps output professional + easy to scan.

Drift policy in config allows per-resource control (auto-heal vs notify-only).

Whole flow feels more like a living system (closer to Kubernetes) than a batch executor.

Would you like me to also sketch a visual DAG graph output (like what commit would show in a terminal with parallel execution), so Runestone feels even more ‚Äúalive‚Äù than Terraform?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs imagine a Runestone DAG graph output for commit or align. This would give users a live sense of resource dependencies and parallelism, something Terraform doesn‚Äôt show natively.

üîπ Features of the DAG Output

Dependency-aware

Shows the exact execution order.

Resources with no dependency run in parallel.

Live Status Indicators

[] Completed
[~] Updating
[+] Creating
[-] Removing
[!] Drift detected

Optional live updates while committing.

Collapsible / Groupable

Modules collapse into a single node (core-network) for simplicity.

Expandable to show sub-resources if needed.

Color-Coding

Green = created/updated successfully

Yellow = updated

Red = failed

Blue = drift detected

üîπ Why This Makes Runestone Unique

Terraform shows a flat list: you see apply order only if you inspect the plan carefully.

Runestone‚Äôs DAG makes dependencies obvious, highlights parallelizable work, and gives visual reassurance that your changes won‚Äôt break something upstream.

Works especially well in large infra repos with hundreds of resources.

If you want, I can draft a full end-to-end demo workflow combining:

YAML config

bootstrap ‚Üí preview ‚Üí DAG view ‚Üí commit ‚Üí align

So you have a concrete narrative of how a dev/team would actually use Runestone from start to finish.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
yes.
also, let's focus on getting runestone mvp for AWS first before moving to other cloud providers.
we can also address kubernetes at the same time if possible.
as well as that, how would it know what the syntax would be to convert and call the provider's APIs? and how would this be updated over time when the provider changes or adds features and products?
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs scope Runestone MVP for AWS first, with optional Kubernetes support, and then address the provider API integration problem.

üîπ Runestone MVP Scope (AWS + Kubernetes)

1. Core MVP Goals

AWS-focused resources only (S3, EC2, RDS, IAM, VPC, Lambda).

Kubernetes resources (pods, deployments, services, namespaces) ‚Äî optional layer on top.

Stateless execution (no centralized state file).

Drift detection + alignment loop.

Human-readable YAML config.

DAG-based parallel execution.

CLI: bootstrap, preview, commit, align, dismantle.

2. CLI Example Workflow (AWS + K8s)

runestone bootstrap      # install AWS & K8s providers, validate config
runestone preview        # detect drift, show Option A summary
runestone commit --graph # apply changes with DAG visualization
runestone align          # reconcile drift in live infra

üîπ How Runestone Calls Provider APIs

Terraform uses provider plugins written in Go, which know the schema and API endpoints. We can adopt a similar approach, but with a few key differences for MVP:

1. Provider SDK Approach

Each provider (AWS, K8s) has a Runestone SDK module.

The SDK contains:

Resource schemas (type definitions for validation).

Functions/methods to translate YAML config ‚Üí API calls.

Optional caching of live resource state for drift detection.

2. Runtime Execution

Runestone reads infra.yaml.

For each resource:

Validate against schema.

Map properties ‚Üí API call parameters.

Call cloud API to create/update/delete resource.

For drift: fetch live resource state ‚Üí compare against desired state.

3. Updating with Provider Changes

Providers evolve constantly, so we need versioned SDKs:

Example: aws-sdk version 0.1.0 ‚Üí AWS RDS v1 API.

Updates delivered as new SDK releases (0.2.0, 0.3.0).

Runestone CLI can pin provider SDK versions, like:

providers:
  aws:
    version: "0.3.0"

Users can upgrade SDKs when ready ‚Üí new features become available automatically.

4. Schema + API Mapping

Resource schemas define allowed properties, required fields, and types.

SDK contains translation layer: property ‚Üí API call field.

SDK can be auto-generated partially using OpenAPI specs / CloudFormation resource definitions to avoid writing every API by hand.

üîπ Example: AWS S3 Bucket SDK (Pseudocode)
type S3Bucket struct {
    Name      string
    Versioning bool
    Tags      map[string]string
}

func (b *S3Bucket) Create() error {
    input := &s3.CreateBucketInput{
        Bucket: aws.String(b.Name),
        Tags:   convertTags(b.Tags),
    }
    _, err := awsClient.CreateBucket(input)
    return err
}

func (b *S3Bucket) Update(liveState*S3Bucket) error {
    // compare liveState ‚Üí desiredState
    // call API to reconcile differences
}

This pattern is repeated for each resource type.

Using Go SDK for AWS ensures compatibility with provider updates.

üîπ Kubernetes Support

Treat Kubernetes as another provider.

YAML config maps directly to K8s manifests (kind, metadata, spec).

Use client-go to perform API calls.

Drift detection = compare live cluster state with YAML desired state.

Align loop = reconcile changes (kubectl apply-style but integrated into Runestone).

üîπ MVP Provider Update Strategy

Versioned SDKs ‚Üí pin provider API versions.

Auto-generate schema & API mapping from:

AWS CloudFormation spec

OpenAPI definitions (for new services/features)

Release updates as new Runestone provider SDK versions.

User chooses when to upgrade ‚Üí avoids breaking changes.

If you want, I can draft a full end-to-end AWS + K8s Runestone MVP workflow, showing:

YAML config for AWS + K8s resources

CLI commands: bootstrap ‚Üí preview ‚Üí commit ‚Üí align

DAG visualization

Drift detection and alignment

So you can see exactly how a user would use Runestone in practice.

Do you want me to do that next?

ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs finalize the Runestone MVP spec for Ataiva so you can start building. I‚Äôll consolidate everything we‚Äôve discussed into a concise, actionable spec.

üîπ Runestone MVP Specification (Ataiva Software)

Product Name: Runestone
Company: Ataiva Software
GitHub: <https://github.com/ataiva-software/runestone>

Focus: AWS first, optional Kubernetes support

1. Problem Statement

Existing IaC tools (Terraform, Pulumi, etc.) suffer from:

Centralized state files causing lock contention and drift.

Drift detection only at apply time.

Complex module/version management.

Limited multi-cloud orchestration and visibility.

Runestone solves this by:

Stateless execution with real-time reconciliation.

DAG-based orchestration for parallelism and dependency clarity.

Strongly-typed, human-readable YAML configs.

Drift detection and optional auto-healing.

Extensible provider SDKs for AWS (and later Kubernetes/multi-cloud).

2. Primary MVP Goals
Feature Description
Providers AWS MVP (S3, EC2, RDS, IAM, VPC, Lambda)
Kubernetes Optional MVP support (pods, deployments, services, namespaces)
CLI Commands: bootstrap, preview, commit, align, dismantle
Config YAML-based, strongly-typed, schema-validated
Drift Detects differences between desired & live state; optional auto-heal
Execution DAG engine; parallel execution with dependency resolution
Output Option A summary style; optional DAG visualization in terminal
Modules Versioned, reusable modules; input/output schema validated
CI/CD JSON/Markdown output for pipelines
3. CLI Commands & Workflow
Command Description
bootstrap Install providers, pull modules, validate configuration
preview Dry-run + drift detection; outputs Option A summary (+ create, ~ update, - remove)
commit Apply changes; DAG visualization optional with --graph
align Continuously reconcile drift; optional auto-heal per resource
dismantle Destroy infra; dependency-aware
4. Config File Structure

      autoHeal: true
      notifyOnly: false

kind: <provider>:<service>:<resource> (namespaced for clarity)

properties: strict schema per resource

driftPolicy: per-resource auto-heal or notify-only

5. Provider Integration

AWS SDK (Go) for API calls.

Resource schemas validate user input, map properties ‚Üí API calls.

Drift detection: fetch live resource state ‚Üí compare with desired config.

Versioned provider SDKs ensure updates when AWS adds new features.

Optional auto-generation of schemas from AWS CloudFormation/OpenAPI specs for faster updates.

6. Execution Engine

Build DAG from resource dependencies.

Parallel execution where safe; deterministic order where required.

Real-time status updates ([+] create, [~] update, [-] remove, [!] drift).

DAG visualization option for CLI (--graph).

7. Output

Option A style summary:

Changes detected:

+ 1 new resource will be created
   ~ 2 resources will be updated

+ 1 resource will be removed

Optional DAG visualization shows dependencies & execution flow.

JSON/Markdown export for CI/CD integration.

8. MVP Roadmap

Phase 1 (AWS MVP)

AWS resources: S3, EC2, RDS, IAM, VPC, Lambda

CLI commands, YAML config, Option A summaries

DAG execution engine, drift detection

Phase 2 (Kubernetes + modules)

K8s provider: pods, deployments, services, namespaces

Module system fully functional

DAG visualization CLI

Phase 3 (Advanced features)

Auto-heal drift per policy

Multi-cloud provider SDKs (GCP, Azure)

Policy-as-code, observability, infra linting

This spec is enough to start coding the MVP:

CLI skeleton + command routing

YAML parser + schema validation

AWS provider SDK integration (create/update/delete + drift)

DAG engine + parallel execution

Option A summary + optional DAG visualization

If you want, I can also sketch the initial Go project structure + packages specifically tailored for building Runestone MVP on AWS, so you can start coding immediately.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
what about if you want ternary conditions or loops to create multiple of the same resource?
yaml isn't great for this. how do we cater for this?
ChatGPT said:

Exactly ‚Äî plain YAML is great for declarative configs, but it doesn‚Äôt support expressions, loops, or conditional logic, which are essential if you want things like:

Creating multiple resources dynamically (count/for_each)

Conditional properties (if/else)

Computed values from variables

Here‚Äôs how Runestone MVP can handle this without becoming Terraform/HCL:

üîπ Option 1: Embedded Expression Language

Introduce a minimal, safe expression language inside YAML properties. Think of it like JS/Go templates or Starlark:

Example: Multiple S3 Buckets
resources:

+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: "logs-${index}"
    count: 3
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags:
        env: "prod"

How it works:

count is evaluated at runtime ‚Üí generates multiple resources.

${index} is replaced with 0..N-1.

Can add simple ternary logic:

      tags:
        env: "${environment == 'prod' ? 'prod' : 'dev'}"

Expression language is typed, sandboxed, so no arbitrary code execution.

üîπ Option 2: YAML + Templating Preprocessor

Allow Runestone to parse templated YAML:

Use Go text/template or sprig functions.

Users can write loops/conditions in a separate templating layer:

{{- range $i, $region := .regions }}
+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
  name: "logs-{{ $region }}"
  properties:
    versioning: true
    tags:
      region: "{{ $region }}"
{{- end }}

Runestone renders the template before validation.

Variables can come from: CLI args, environment, or a vars.yaml file.

üîπ Option 3: Hybrid YAML + Inline DSL

You can introduce a small Runestone DSL inside YAML for advanced features:

resources:

+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: logs
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags: !expr |
        env = environment == "prod" ? "prod" : "dev"
    count: !expr 3

!expr marks a property as an evaluated expression.

Keeps main YAML readable while adding programmatic flexibility.

üîπ Recommended Approach for MVP

Start with count and basic ternary conditions using Option 1 (expression language):

Simple, safe, readable

Covers most common use cases: multiple resources, conditional tags, computed values

Optionally support templating preprocessing (Option 2) later:

For advanced loops or dynamic module generation

Keep it strongly typed ‚Äî expressions are evaluated before resource creation, so you can validate the result against the schema.

üîπ Example: AWS + Loops + Conditional Tags
project: analytics-platform
environment: prod

resources:

+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: "logs-${index}"
    count: 3
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags:
        env: "${environment == 'prod' ? 'prod' : 'dev'}"

What Runestone does:

Expands count=3 ‚Üí generates 3 resources (logs-0, logs-1, logs-2).

Evaluates ${environment == 'prod' ? 'prod' : 'dev'} ‚Üí assigns "prod" to all.

Validates properties against AWS schema.

Adds resources to DAG ‚Üí executes in parallel where possible.

If you want, I can update the full Runestone YAML spec to natively support count, loops, and ternary expressions while staying readable, so it‚Äôs ready for MVP implementation.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
should we rather look at this more like a programming language or is keeping this approach better?
ChatGPT said:

That‚Äôs the key design decision ‚Äî whether Runestone should feel like a programming language or a declarative config with light expressions. Let‚Äôs break it down carefully.

1‚É£ Declarative + YAML/DSL (current approach)

Pros:

Familiar to DevOps teams: very close to Terraform/HCL or CloudFormation.

Easy to read at scale: plain YAML is simple for humans to scan.

Strong validation possible: schemas can catch errors before API calls.

Safe: no arbitrary code execution.

Fast MVP: expression language (count, ternary, computed vars) is lightweight.

Cons:

Limited programmability: loops, complex conditionals, dynamic calculations are cumbersome.

Templating required for advanced logic: might feel ‚Äúhacky‚Äù at scale.

Not as flexible for modules that need logic (like generating N resources based on API query).

2‚É£ Full Programming Language Approach

Imagine a Runestone DSL / embedded language (like Pulumi or CDK) where config is code (Go, Python, Rust, or custom DSL).

Pros:

Full expressiveness: loops, conditionals, functions, data structures.

Dynamic generation: resources can be created based on runtime values.

Reusability: functions, classes, modules.

Easier for devs familiar with programming: less ‚Äútemplate gymnastics.‚Äù

Cons:

Steeper learning curve for DevOps engineers who just want declarative infra.

Harder to validate statically: errors might appear only at runtime.

Harder to keep human-readable at scale: massive scripts vs. clean YAML.

More work for MVP: language parser, runtime, security sandboxing.

3‚É£ Recommended MVP Approach

Hybrid declarative + lightweight expressions:

Keep YAML as the primary config: humans can read it at scale.

Add controlled expressions:

count / loops

ternary / conditional logic

computed values from variables

Avoid full programming language initially.

Why this works for MVP:

Covers 90% of real-world use cases.

Keeps the tool lightweight, safe, and readable.

Still leaves room to add an embedded DSL in future releases for advanced users.

üîπ Example of Hybrid Config (MVP-ready)
project: analytics-platform
environment: prod
regions: [us-east-1, us-west-2]

resources:

+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: "logs-${region}"
    for_each: "${regions}"
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags:
        env: "${environment == 'prod' ? 'prod' : 'dev'}"

for_each ‚Üí simple iteration

${} ‚Üí ternary / computed values

YAML ‚Üí keeps everything readable and declarative

 Bottom line:

MVP: stay declarative + lightweight expressions.

Future: if advanced users demand programmability, consider embedded DSL / scripting layer on top of YAML.

If you want, I can update the Runestone MVP spec to natively support loops, count, for_each, and ternary expressions, keeping it fully declarative but expressive enough for most AWS use cases. This would be the final YAML spec for coding.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes, do that, along with anything else that would be obviously useful.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs finalize the Runestone YAML spec for the MVP, fully declarative, with loops, count/for_each, ternary expressions, and other obviously useful features so you can start building.

# Single resource

+ kind: aws:s3:bucket
    name: logs-main
    properties:
      versioning: true
      tags: "${tags}"
    driftPolicy:
      autoHeal: true
      notifyOnly: false

# Multiple resources using count

2‚É£ Supported Expressions

Ternary / conditional

tags:
  env: "${environment == 'prod' ? 'prod' : 'dev'}"

Count / index expansion

count: 3
name: "web-${index}"

For-each loops

for_each: "${regions}"
name: "logs-${region}"

Variable interpolation

region: "${region}"
tags: "${tags}"

All expressions are evaluated before validation, keeping schemas strictly typed.

3‚É£ Drift & Policies

driftPolicy.autoHeal ‚Üí Runestone attempts to fix drift automatically.

driftPolicy.notifyOnly ‚Üí only report drift, don‚Äôt modify.

Optional per-resource drift policy allows flexible enforcement.

4‚É£ DAG / Dependency Features

Dependencies inferred automatically:

Modules ‚Üí sub-resources

Explicit dependencies supported:

depends_on: [module:vpc, aws:s3:bucket.logs-main]

DAG determines execution order; resources without dependencies run in parallel.

5‚É£ CLI Commands (MVP)
Command Description
bootstrap Install provider SDKs, pull modules, validate config
preview Dry-run + drift detection; outputs Option A summary
commit Apply changes; optional DAG visualization --graph
align Continuously reconcile drift
dismantle Destroy resources (dependency-aware)

Example Preview Output (Option A style):

Changes detected:

+ 1 new resource will be created
   ~ 2 resources will be updated

+ 1 resource will be removed

DAG Graph Example (commit --graph):

   +----------------+

+--------+    +--------+

6‚É£ Additional Useful Features for MVP

Global Variables (variables)

Allow re-use of tags, regions, and other common parameters.

Explicit Dependencies (depends_on)

Useful when DAG inference is insufficient.

Optional Resource Namespacing

Allows team or environment prefixes to avoid collisions.

Module Versioning

Modules are versioned to ensure reproducible infra.

Safe Expression Evaluation

Sandbox expressions ‚Üí no arbitrary code execution.

Optional Output / Export

JSON or Markdown for CI/CD reporting.

 This YAML spec is fully declarative, human-readable, supports loops, ternaries, variables, drift policies, DAG execution, and modules.

It‚Äôs ready to implement as the Runestone MVP for AWS, with optional Kubernetes extension later.

If you want, I can also draft a Go package skeleton + folder structure that directly implements this spec with provider SDKs, DAG engine, expression evaluator, and CLI commands ‚Äî so you can start coding immediately.

Do you want me to do that?

    name: analytics-db
    properties:
      storage_gb: "${environment == 'prod' ? 100 : 20}"
      backup_enabled: "${environment == 'prod'}"

 Notes on the Update

Module source URLs now point to the Ataiva GitHub org:

source: github.com/ataiva-software/aws-vpc

Keeps the same count / for_each / ternary / drift policy features.

All other aspects remain fully declarative, DAG-ready, and ready for AWS MVP.

If you want, I can now draft the Go project skeleton with folders and packages tailored for this Ataiva-centric spec, including:

CLI commands (bootstrap, preview, commit, align, dismantle)

YAML parser + expression evaluator

DAG engine

AWS provider SDK integration

This would be the ready-to-code foundation for Runestone.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
no, i mean something like github.com/ataiva-software/runestone/modules/aws-vpc or something
ChatGPT said:

Ah! Got it ‚Äî you want the modules to live under the Runestone repo/org structure, rather than as standalone repos. That makes sense for maintainability. Here‚Äôs how we should reference them:

üîπ Updated Module Reference Structure
modules:
  vpc:
    source: github.com/ataiva-software/runestone/modules/aws-vpc
    version: 1.2.0
    inputs:
      cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
      subnets:
        - name: public
          cidr: "10.0.1.0/24"
        - name: private
          cidr: "10.0.2.0/24"

Repo structure on GitHub:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-vpc/

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-ec2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/

This keeps all Runestone modules centralized in the same org/repo, making versioning, CI/CD, and releases easier.

Modules can still have independent versions (tags or subdirectory versioning).

 Benefits

Organized under a single repo/org ‚Üí easier to maintain.

Versioning per module using tags or a module registry within the repo.

Consistent import path in YAML ‚Üí github.com/ataiva-software/runestone/modules/<module-name>.

Simplifies MVP ‚Üí no need to manage dozens of separate repos at first.

If you want, I can rewrite the full Runestone YAML MVP spec to use this new modules path style and ensure everything is aligned for AWS MVP.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
should it live in this same source code repo for runestone, or in a runestone-modules repo rather?
ChatGPT said:

It depends on how you want to manage development, versioning, and releases. Here‚Äôs a careful breakdown of both approaches:

1‚É£ Keep modules inside the same Runestone repo

Pros:

Simpler for MVP: everything in one repo ‚Üí easier to bootstrap and test.

Tightly coupled: CLI, provider SDKs, and modules evolve together.

Single release cycle: no need to manage multiple repos/tags.

Easier for early contributors: just clone one repo.

Cons:

Repo grows large over time with many modules.

Harder to version modules independently.

Updates to one module require a full Runestone release.

Structure Example:

runestone/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-vpc/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-s3/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-ec2/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/

YAML reference:

modules:
  vpc:
    source: github.com/ataiva-software/runestone/modules/aws-vpc
    version: 1.0.0

2‚É£ Put modules in a separate runestone-modules repo

Pros:

Independent versioning: each module can release its own version.

Cleaner repo: CLI + core engine separate from modules.

Easier to share and reuse across different projects/orgs.

Can develop modules independently from Runestone core.

Cons:

More initial setup: multiple repos, CI/CD, submodule or registry management.

Developers need to manage multiple repos when contributing to MVP.

Structure Example:

runestone/                  # core engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/

runestone-modules/          # separate repo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-vpc/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-s3/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-ec2/

YAML reference:

modules:
  vpc:
    source: github.com/ataiva-software/runestone-modules/aws-vpc
    version: 1.0.0

 Recommendation for MVP

Start with modules inside the main Runestone repo: simpler for MVP development, testing, and early contributors.

Later, migrate to a separate runestone-modules repo once you have enough modules and want independent versioning.

This approach balances speed of development with future scalability.

If you want, I can update the Runestone MVP YAML spec and repo structure for the ‚Äúmodules in same repo‚Äù approach, fully ready for coding.

üîπ Features Supported in MVP

Loops & Dynamic Resource Generation

count ‚Üí repeated resources with ${index}

for_each ‚Üí iterate over arrays

Ternary / Conditional Expressions

${condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse}

Works in properties, tags, and module inputs

Global Variables

variables section ‚Üí reusable values across resources/modules

Drift Policies

autoHeal: automatically reconcile differences

notifyOnly: report drift without changing resources

DAG & Parallel Execution

Dependencies inferred from modules/resources

Optional depends_on for explicit ordering

Modules

Centralized inside runestone/modules

Versioned per module (version: x.y.z)

CLI Commands

bootstrap, preview, commit, align, dismantle

 Why This Is Ready for MVP Development

All AWS core resources included.

Supports loops, conditions, and variables for dynamic infra.

Modules live inside the same repo ‚Üí simple for MVP.

DAG engine + drift policies make execution predictable and safe.

CLI workflow fully defined.
